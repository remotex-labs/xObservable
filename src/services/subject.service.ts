 *
 * @remarks
 * Unlike {@link ObservableService}, which runs its handler once per subscriber, a subject shares a single emission
 * sequence across all current observers. Values are pushed directly through {@link next}, {@link error}, and
 * {@link complete}. Unsubscribing removes the observer from the active set.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const subject = new SubjectService<number>();
 * subject.subscribe(v => console.log('A', v));
 * subject.subscribe(v => console.log('B', v));
 * subject.next(42); // both observers receive 42
 * subject.complete();
 * ```
